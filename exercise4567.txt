4) Give the name and length of the third largest gene in the genome.

mysql> select gene_name, (seq_region_end-seq_region_start) as length from gene order by (seq_region_end-seq_region_start) desc limit 1 offset 2;
+-----------+---------+
| gene_name | length  |
+-----------+---------+
| PARP1     | 2493039 |
+-----------+---------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)



5) Give the name of the gene with the most exons? Give the number of exons of this gene?





6) Give the name of the chromosome with the most genes associated with breast cancer. Give the number of transcripts of this chromosome? (2 queries)

mysql> select chromosome, description from gene where description like "%breast%" or "%cancer%";




7)Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table (2 queries). Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.

exon: 642590 rows
exon_transcipt: 1178393 rows

An exon can have multiple transcript, there fore there are more exontranscripts than exons.
