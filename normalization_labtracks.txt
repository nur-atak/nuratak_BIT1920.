The words in capital letters are the primary keys

UNF 	lab(personnel_NR, name, dateofbirth, labcode, labname, researchcode, researchdescr, research_visor)


This is only copy/paste the information

1NF 	personnel(PERSONNEL_NR, name, dateofbirth)
	lab(LABCODE, labname, RESEARCHCODE)
	research(RESEARCHCODE, researchdescr, research_visor)

All repeating and calculating groups have to be eliminated in individual tables. I created separate tables for each set of related data. And each set has a primary key.

2NF 	personnel(PERSONNEL_NR, name, dateofbirth)
	lab(LABCODE, labname, RESEARCHCODE)
	research(RESEARCHCODE, researchdescr, research_visor, PERSONNEL_NR)

Every non key attribute is dependent on a key and because a labmember can play a role in multiple researches, the PERSONNEL_NR is added to research.


3NF	personnel(PERSONNEL_NR, name, dateofbirth)
	lab(LABCODE, labname, RESEARCHCODE)
	research(RESEARCHCODE, researchdescr, research_visor, PERSONNEL_NR)

Every attribute is dependent on a key. The same as in 2NF
